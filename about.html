<h2>Kilmer One</h2>
<p>
Kilner was born on 17 October 1890 in Wombwell, Barnsley, Yorkshire, England, the second son and one of eleven children of Seth Kilner and Mary Alice Washington.[2] His brother Norman also played cricket, representing Yorkshire and Warwickshire.[3] The Kilners attended Wombwell Parish Church and the boys were members of the Church Lads' Brigade.[3] His father and his uncle, Irving Washington, the former Yorkshire player, encouraged him to play cricket from an early age. He showed enough ability to join the local colliery team, Mitchell Main.[3]

His bowling was more effective but used infrequently.[4] By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire
